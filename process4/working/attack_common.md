# Common brief for workers attacking the Process4 definition (14 Nov 2026)

## Background
Bob is the owner. He is not a programmer in this role: he defines the product and the process in plain words; Claude decides everything technical and reports it. Process3 was his development process: Claude Code cloud sessions, in Auto mode, built his product Civicsmith in a GitHub repository unattended. It failed: sessions kept adding checks, gates, reviews and record-keeping to the process's own tooling until product work stopped. Process4 is its successor. Its definition, second draft, is the document under attack:

  /home/user/handoff/process4_definition_v2.md   (read it in full, first)

The first draft is process4_definition_main.md in the same folder (for comparison only). The appendix (process4_definition_appendix.md, being updated separately as _v2) maps 288 requirement lines.

## Bob's fixed decisions (not open to attack as decisions; attack whether the definition honours them and whether they can work)
- Exactly three tests, and no others, ever: a job's own module tests; the interface notice; the internal walk.
- No layers. One total order of modules. A job does not wait for the modules it uses. Eight job slots by default; only Bob changes the number.
- No review by a fresh reviewer.
- A process fix may only correct or remove; it never adds a test, gate, review or stop.
- Process3's permission management is preserved (standing approvals in CLAUDE.md committed by Bob, deny list in settings.json, merging through the process's merge tool).
- ROOT is the first session; ROOT and the coordinator are different sessions.
- Bob enters no commands and edits no source files. Only words Bob wrote count as his word.
- Nothing may be asserted to work that has not been measured. "Proven" and "not proven" must be kept apart.

## Hard rule for your remedies
You may NOT propose, as the answer to any weakness, a new test, gate, review, check, audit, approval step by a session, or monitoring job. Process4 has three tests, ever. A remedy may be: removing something, a structural choice, a permission or setting, a change of wording, an honest statement that a risk is accepted and unproven, or a trial (a one-off measurement before the process is in force, not a standing check). If the only remedy you can see is a new check, say exactly that and leave it as an unanswered counter-argument.

## Evidence available (folder /home/user/handoff/; use grep, read passages not whole files)
- Bob's requirement documents: foundations.md (Process3 Foundations), ledger_lines.md (the Keep and Drop Ledger, 159 lines with his decisions and notes), ledger_map.md, DECISIONS.md (Process3 decision records; quotes Bob), process4_disposition.md / .tsv (288 rows: every requirement line with id, text and disposition).
- /home/user/work/assessment_doc.txt: a session's record of Bob's decisions of 13 and 14 Nov (near the top). /home/user/work/live_docs.md: what is and is not in Bob's own words. /home/user/work/ledger_store/: his stored answers.
- Post-mortem evidence: review.txt, verify_numbers.md, causal_forensics.md, change_sample.md, canon_analysis.md, product_side.md, bob_naming.md.
- Design evidence: interface_and_cycle.md, no_layers_width.md, roles_root_coordinator.md, permissions_inventory.md, levers_github_cloudflare_product.md.
- Earlier attacks on an earlier, withdrawn proposal (not this definition): redteam_corruption.md, redteam_feasibility.md, audit_A.md to audit_D_central.md. Use them as a source of attacks that may still apply; check each against the second draft before repeating it.
- Notes by today's workers: /home/user/work/enforcement_levers.md (physical stops against added checks), /home/user/work/k_evidence.md (evidence on Bob's seven questions).
- Read-only clones: /home/user/repos/process3, /home/user/repos/civicsmith-copy (product; branches origin/tranche and origin/process-state). Never commit, push, or change anything in them. Start no cloud sessions.

## How to report
Write your full findings to the file named in your task. For every finding give:
 1. The counter-argument, in one or two plain sentences Bob could read (no ids or codes in that sentence; put ids in a separate "sources" line).
 2. Which sentence(s) of the definition it attacks (quote them).
 3. Evidence: measured in the record (cite file and passage) / stated in a platform document / your reasoning only. Keep these apart.
 4. How bad if true: stops the first hour / stops a tranche / silently corrupts the result / costs Bob time / misleads Bob / minor.
 5. Your best answer within the hard rule above, or "no answer found".
Rank findings worst first. Do not pad: a finding you cannot support is noise. Do not soften: if the definition would not run as written, say so first.
