# Common brief for the second full audit of the Process4 definition (14 Nov 2026)

The owner, Bob, asked for this in his own words: "perhaps this is a good time to repeat the full audit of process4 as currently defined, including a counter-argument audit. This will give a clearer look at that shape the design is in and provide a map where the focus is still needed."

## What is audited
The fifth draft: /home/user/handoff/process4_definition_v5.md. Read it in full, first. It supersedes all earlier drafts.

## Background
Bob is the owner. In this role he is not a programmer: he defines the product and the process in plain words; Claude decides what is technical and reports it. Process3 was his earlier process: Claude Code cloud sessions, in Auto mode, built his product Civicsmith in a GitHub repository unattended. It failed because sessions kept adding checks, gates, reviews and record-keeping to the process until product work stopped. Process4 is its successor.

## What outranks what
1. Bob's own typed words of 14 Nov 2026, verbatim in /home/user/work/bob_words_14nov_b.md and /home/user/work/bob_words_14nov_c.md (read both in full; the second holds three messages, the last answering three readings on the tranche and release). These outrank everything.
2. The session's record of his decisions of 13-14 Nov (quoted in the fifth draft's section B; source text /home/user/work/assessment_doc.txt, near the top).
3. His requirement documents: /home/user/handoff/foundations.md, /home/user/handoff/ledger_lines.md (with his stored answers in /home/user/work/ledger_store/), /home/user/handoff/process4_disposition.tsv (288 rows).
Do not attack his typed words as decisions. Attack whether the definition honours them, whether they can work as written, and what they leave undefined. Where two of his own statements conflict, report the conflict; do not choose.

## His fixed points now
- Three tests, and no others, ever: module tests, the internal walk, the external walk. The notification to a user module is not a test.
- "The 3 tests provide an appropriate opportunity to identify and debug as necessary every flaw and to test everything that needs to work in a released product. There is no need to any any more tests. PERIOD!"
- A tranche ends only when an external walk of a development deployment completes without flaws; flaws go to the next round. A tranche can end without an AI-enabled run. Installer and website are outside the tranche and wait for a clean development release walk.
- A job writes its own tests. A job for module A is not allowed to change module B; the only other way a module is edited is a mechanical edit.
- The process is changed only in a separate lane, PROCESS, that he interacts with; he chooses among options; a product moves to an updated process only with his prior approval.
- No layers; one total order of modules; eight job slots across the account; no review by a fresh reviewer; permission management preserved from Process3.
- The notification rule (what counts as an interface change, who is told, what a told module does) is under study in a separate session; audit what the draft says about it but do not re-derive the study (/home/user/work/notice_study/study.md holds the groundwork).

## Hard rule for remedies
You may NOT propose a new test, gate, review, check, audit, monitoring job or approval step by a session as the answer to anything. A remedy may be: removing something; a structural choice; a permission or setting; a change of wording; restoring something from his documents; an honest statement that a risk is accepted and unproven; a one-off trial before the process is in force. If the only remedy you can see is a new check, say exactly that and leave the finding unanswered.

## Evidence
- Folder /home/user/handoff/: the post-mortem and design evidence (review.txt, verify_numbers.md, causal_forensics.md, change_sample.md, canon_analysis.md, product_side.md, interface_and_cycle.md, no_layers_width.md, roles_root_coordinator.md, permissions_inventory.md, levers_github_cloudflare_product.md, DECISIONS.md).
- Folder /home/user/work/: the first audit round on the second draft (attack_corruption.md, attack_feasibility.md, audit_foundations.md, audit_ledger.md), its register (/home/user/handoff/process4_counterarguments.md, 87 entries with answers, and /home/user/work/register_notes.md), the memo of answers (decisions_memo_d3.md), drafting notes (v3_notes.md, v4_notes.md, v5_notes.md), enforcement_levers.md, k_evidence.md, trial_plan_facts.md, replay/results.md, notice_study/study.md.
- Read-only clones: /home/user/repos/process3, /home/user/repos/civicsmith-copy (product; branches origin/tranche and origin/process-state), /home/user/repos/process3-probes. Never commit, push, fetch into or check out in them. Start no cloud sessions.
Use grep and read passages; do not read every file end to end.

## How to report
Write your full findings to the file named in your task. For every finding:
 1. The counter-argument or fault, in one to three plain sentences Bob could read (no ids, codes or file names in that sentence).
 2. The sentence(s) of the fifth draft concerned (quoted), and the source it is measured against.
 3. What it rests on: measured in the record (cite) / a platform document / reasoning only. Keep apart.
 4. How bad: stops the first hour / stops a tranche / silently spoils the result / costs Bob time / misleads Bob / minor.
 5. Status against the first round: NEW; or RAISED BEFORE AND STILL OPEN (name the register entry); or RAISED BEFORE AND NOW ANSWERED (say by what — his words, a decision, a correction — and whether the answer really meets it).
 6. Your best answer within the hard rule, or "no answer found".
 7. Whose it is: Bob's to decide (say why it is not technical) / Claude's to decide / needs a trial / needs the build.
Rank worst first. Do not pad. Do not soften. At the end give a one-page MAP: the areas of the design (roles and sessions; flow of a job; rounds, walks and tranche end; release; notification; PROCESS and process change; permissions and starting; state and waking; recovery; reports; what is unbuilt; what is unproven), each rated solid / stated but unproven / thin / contradictory / missing, with one line of why.
