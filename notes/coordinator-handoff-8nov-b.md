## Addresses
ROOT session_018BhcefMKiLuojtdyeh1nzG. BOB session_018Bhceff4p3dNtYx3XNk4CX. Watcher session_018BhcegBeapVuoF7cgLpEeR. Builders: ef7 session_018Bhcef7TXuVjVZ4eN1SCzE (free), ef1 session_018Bhcef1pxNYJCcaejqj138 (free after C33). Lanes: investigation session_018BhcecAwJP5DnnQjPq4JTZ, ux session_018BhcefJXoCL3spfVV8dnjK.
My tasks, bound to me (rebind to yourself, then delete mine): hourly trig_01UM5F6JQcjMqvveKMMMox66 (:51); Phase 1 survival trig_01Y6XmA16RGwZJRoGq2ie3yD (16 Nov 17:00Z); Phase 2 survival trig_01JVYdmkuDSyzJUEStfcNNCC (18 Nov 17:00Z). Then set the probes' process/config.json coordinator to yourself (plain PR, as probes PR 252; merge it with the merge tool, --plain --rounds 1, from the probes clone running the tranche tool).

## State
Copy: the plan's 11 layers are all merged (layer 11 at 45824bea, 14.06 h). Round 1 closed WITHOUT a development release: the live walk of p3dev-l11 failed outside F10 (640 undefined classes, 1050 DEC-340 overlaps, 1 screens-daily R22). The completion round 2 file is on the copy tranche (build/plan/completion-round-2.md, 10 items; CR2-1 corpus-export ticked, PR 825). The other 9: journey-check (F10 + PD-11), interface-assets (repin to ux PR 996), interface-shell (drop mk-lvlbtn, cs-menu; every drawn class defined; DEC-340 by the re-walk), screens-daily (R22), provenance (BD-18), leg-earning (BD-18), ai-runs, hypotheses (IV-H F1), inquiry (IV-H F2).

## In flight at handoff
- C33 MERGED: process3 PR 256 at 0590382c (completion round opens as layer n+1 from completion_file; layer merge ticks landed items; my suite 1177/1177).
- Pins of 0590382c running: copy session_018Bhcedq5mYbUHEVDaNAanD, probes session_018BhcedBSqTyJb7jc15iHta. Each reports to the coordinator address; archive each when it reports.
- BOB, on the copy pin's wake: `layer open 12` (the completion round), `layer jobs 12`, start in order (journey-check first; interface-shell after interface-assets lands). Any refusal: its words come to you; the fix is a builder's.
- Round 2 close: layer merge 12 (ticks items), internal walk (now with page checks once journey-check lands, PD-11), deploy, live walk, then release dev under PD-10.

## Decisions of mine today (DECISIONS.md on process3 tranche)
PD-9 (gate verifies built generated rows, PR 251), PD-10 (a recorded owed walk mark does not block release dev; anything else does, PR 253), PD-11 (internal walk runs the live walk's page checks, PR 254), PD-12 (reopens after the last layer run as the completion round, PR 255). C32 (layer cover per land; merged PR's run bound under a reopen, PR 252) and C33 (PR 256) are their tool changes.

## Bob today
- On Screens (8 Nov): "It sounds like the screens document is being properly maintained and updated/regenerated properly by the UX design lane." Screens stays a claude.ai artifact; ux lane republishes in the same turn as any screen-changing DEC or BD (copy PR 988).
- Open FYI to Bob, no answer owed: BOB drew FOCUS and PROBLEM as one QUESTION node in the Content Framework loop diagram (copy PR 995, BD-16).

## Merge practice
As 8nov: /home/user/p3-base worktree for review merges (merge head with tranche, suite: HOME=$(mktemp -d) GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 node --test 'tool/test/*.test.mjs'); a builder PR draft is marked ready (update_pull_request draft false) before `node tool/p3.mjs merge <n> --plain --rounds 1 --reviewed "..."` from a tranche worktree. The merge waits on CI up to ~10 min: give it a timeout of 1200 s. Pins: `pin move neobobkrause/<repo> --report <me> --why ... --pin <sha>`, then create_session with its JSON.
