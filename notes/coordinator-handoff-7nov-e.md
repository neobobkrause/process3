# Coordinator handoff, 7 Nov 2026 ~23:55Z (session_018BhceejoYb1DR1sDfBk9uU)

## Addresses
ROOT session_018BhcefMKiLuojtdyeh1nzG (the former watcher; sweep trig_0196SqXdWauicZRfKo84MGYm at :07). Watcher session_018BhcegBeapVuoF7cgLpEeR (daily trig_01FcP4QQmJPngvUnFAa8557m, 11:17Z). BOB session_018Bhceff4p3dNtYx3XNk4CX. Builders: ef7 session_018Bhcef7TXuVjVZ4eN1SCzE, ef1 session_018Bhcef1pxNYJCcaejqj138 (both free). Lanes: investigation session_018BhcecAwJP5DnnQjPq4JTZ, ux session_018BhcefJXoCL3spfVV8dnjK.
My tasks to REBIND to the successor, then delete mine: hourly trig_0149fiVTMfw6ESs9mXSwZMNq (:51); Phase 1 survival trig_01H6h3vcgboGXfSaAKcxVZG8 (16 Nov 17:00Z); Phase 2 trig_01VU3vgJ4sMkdoVq4Q2BLYEB (18 Nov 17:00Z). Old ROOT sweep trig_01HBGHt8e2s7qwtHsNoiphgs is switched off (delete it if you like). Probes config coordinator: set by plain PR as usual.

## Layer 11 (copy) — IN FLIGHT
Open 16:10Z. At 23:52Z: 50 complete, 2 deferred (queue-producers; journey-check), 16 not complete, 11 PRs open. It fell back from 62: landing instance-setup 948 and installer-steps rescheduled 14 consumers. Asked BOB (23:52Z) whether the retests are running, to land all remaining interface providers before retesting (one wave), and for an ETA. Layer 11 is the copy's LAST layer: `layer merge 11` closes the round and runs the internal walk, dev deploy and walk inline (C23). BOB runs it in the background and reports. Stop rule 27.6 h → about 19:45Z 8 Nov.
corpus-export: ruled (a): restart on the tranche after layer merge 11 (hold asked of BOB). store-assembly reopen (spread wholeExportOps) and op-grades confirm the rows first.
journey-check (1): installer regression (agent-worker dropped `runner` from /version), fixed in instance-setup F2 (948, landed or landing). (2) group-word scan: BOB routes what remains.

## Process3 today (merged; pins)
241 C24 (marks on sub-lines), 242 C23 Foundations sentence, 243 C25 (startable count agrees; alarm names jobs), 244 PD-7, 245 C26 (published job holds no slot), 246 C27 (no BOB wake on a BOB-less product), 247 PD-8. Pinned on copy and probes: e779f92 (C24), 8a0fabee (C25), f390ebe4 (C26). NOT yet pinned: C27 (6dd556ae) and PD-8 (docs only). Pin C27 with the next fix.

## Bob's decisions today (all recorded)
Q7 "as recommended", Q8 one term per concept → BD-16. Q9.1 → BD-17 (his principle "If it can't be proven, then it shouldn't be part of the conclusion"; marks only order exploration; a rival is ruled out only by a conclusion at the bar that names it; walkthrough v5 WCzdua7ccBB95KbtwGvatt "I like the walkthrough experience"; IV-H1..H3 placed as hypotheses F1, inquiry F2 for the next layer). IV-9 → PD-8 at his word that it is technical (parity rule; floor after first run under AD13, his unless delegated; ai-gate F4). Grade C → BD-18 (doctrine C stands; raw-bytes archive replay = B "via archive"; rewritten replay = C; acquisition F1; provenance reopens after layer 11).
Decisions page: https://claude.ai/artifact/UhokMjV6vDiqwGZHmowKrD (all settled).

## Bob still owes
1. Investigation canon amendments (BD-16): https://claude.ai/artifact/THyuxTMAiQHUSo6rDLYVX4 (the "problem" into "question" judgment).
2. Grade C canon amendments (BD-18): https://claude.ai/artifact/8Jm355VxBXBjJJRtAYcrNq.
On his approval, BOB has the amendments placed.

## Coordinator decisions today
PD-7 (a published job holds no slot), PD-8 (IV-9 parity rule). Rulings: corpus-export (store-assembly + op-grades first, then (a) restart on the tranche after layer merge 11); a fresh watcher after the ROOT takeover.

## Merge practice
As in 7nov-d: from /home/user/p3-base merge the head with the tranche, run the suite, then `node tool/p3.mjs merge <n> --plain --rounds <r> --reviewed "..."`. Mark a draft ready first. Pin: `pin move neobobkrause/<repo> --report <me> --why ... --pin <sha>` prints a prompt; create_session with it (title, source_url, revision tranche, depth 1).
