# Speculative gates in the merge train (option C): build plan

5 Nov 2026, build/train-spec from tranche 74c3679. Design: notes/train-throughput-study.md §3 C on
study/train-throughput, as the coordinator restated it (points 1-5). This page maps each point to
code, lists where the code shows the design cannot run as worded, and says how it is tested.

## Where the code shows a flaw (deviation, put to the coordinator before it is built)

The design says process-gate "runs unchanged" on a draft PR from the job's branch into
`train/spec-<i>`, and that spec branches are reused per position. Four things in the code stop that:

1. **A draft PR's gate runs no suite, and a spec PR has no receipt.** gate.mjs reads the PR's draft
   state live (line 86) and a draft gets trigger `draft`: no suite, no revert, no receipt (line 151).
   Made ready instead, the receipt is read only from that PR's own comments by its opener (line 94):
   a spec PR has none, so the gate is red ("ready but has no receipt", line 269). The gate needs a
   spec mode either way.
2. **A second PR from `job/<id>` breaks three checks that guard against exactly that.**
   - verifyRow (github.mjs 158-161) refuses a run whose listed PRs include one into a base other than
     the tranche ("not a second PR on the same commit into a branch that carries a workflow of its
     own"). While the spec PR is open, the job PR's own rows can stop verifying, and the spec PR's
     rows never verify against the tranche.
   - branchBound (gate.mjs 433-440): any PR ever opened from `job/<id>` into another base removes the
     tranche cover for that job's merge, for good (PRs cannot be deleted). Every speculated module's
     suite would run again in the tranche into main, which is what the cover exists to avoid (cap).
   - Check runs attach to the head commit, shared by both PRs: `checkRun(head, 'gate')` (ready,
     jobChecks, waitForGate, the ruleset's required check) returns whichever ran last. A red spec
     run shows red on the job PR's head.
3. **Reusing `train/spec-<i>` needs a force-push.** Rebuilding position i on a new base is a
   non-fast-forward update. Making each rebuild a descendant of the old tip instead keeps old ahead
   heads reachable; when a job later sits behind a spec that once held its own older head, the merge
   base of the job and the spec becomes that head and GitHub's test merge drops part of the job's
   change (a false red, sent back to the job).
4. **The land as worded loses the tranche cover and the merge row.** GitHub's merge of the job's head
   into a tranche that is not its ancestor is a new merge computed at land time, not checked bytes;
   jobMerge (gate.mjs 450-451) covers only a merge whose head was brought up to the tranche and holds
   the merge row (merge.mjs 204), which today's merge() pushes onto the job branch before its gate.

## The deviation proposed (C', same strength: every land is the tree a green gate tested)

- **Spec pair per build, fresh names, never reused or deleted:** base `train/spec/<pr>-<seq>` at
  R(i-1), head `train/head/<pr>-<seq>` at R(i), where R(i) is the predicted merged result of window
  position i: the job's head merged onto R(i-1) (R(-1) = the tranche tip), plus its merge row. The
  spec PR (draft, into the spec base) shares no branch and no commit with the job PR, so verifyRow,
  branchBound and check runs are untouched. Its gate tests exactly R(i).
- **gate.mjs spec mode** (base ref `train/spec/*`, read from the live PR, so no workflow change): the
  job is the open job PR the branch name gives, whose head is in R(i); it is judged as that job (its
  entry, ownership, imports, revert and suite) and its receipt read from the job PR. Draft does not
  skip the suite in spec mode. The row records the tree it tested.
- **Land, exact bytes:** once every PR ahead landed, merge() builds the job's merged result L on the
  real tranche as today; only if L's tree equals R(i)'s tree, records aside (the rule
  record-since-green already applies), it pushes L to the job branch. The job PR's gate on L takes a
  new fast path, `spec-tested`: a verified green spec row tested this tree; no suite (about 1 min).
  Then mergePR as today: the merge is trivial (tranche is L's ancestor), so the bytes that land are
  L's, equal to the bytes tested. jobMerge follows a `spec-tested` row to its spec row, so the
  tranche cover holds. Trees not equal: today's path (full re-gate of L), said in the row.
- Spec branches accumulate (two per window entry, more on rebuilds); a prune needs Bob.

Cost against the design: a serial ~1-2 min confirm gate per land (the study's simulation assumed
1 min overhead), and a gate.mjs change that takes effect only when the copy's pin moves to it.
Throughput ceiling about 20-25 PRs/h, above today's 12-15 arrivals.

## Point by point (as C')

| point | code |
|---|---|
| 1 window k | `merge_train_window` in config DEFAULTS (4); window.mjs: the pure window (admit in order.mjs's order, plain rows and release-path first, topological prefix for provider holds); train.mjs builds R(i) and the spec pair per position |
| 2 tree land | merge.mjs `specLand`: L built as today, `tree(L) == tree(R(i))` records aside, else today's re-gate; gate.mjs `spec-tested` fast path; jobMerge follows it |
| 3 red at i | window.mjs `onRed(i)`: i back to its job as today (refuse); every spec behind closed (PR closed, cause named) and rebuilt on the new R chain; plain and release-path keep priority; the in-flight hold covers the head of the window while its confirm gate runs |
| 4 branches | fresh `train/spec/<pr>-<seq>` / `train/head/<pr>-<seq>`, pushed fast-forward only (new refs), never deleted; spec PRs closed, not deleted; no workflow change, no permission, no trigger |
| 5 causes | every window row (`metrics/train-window.jsonl` on the state branch) names its cause: admit, build, spec PR opened, closed (red ahead, base moved, head moved, withdrawn), landed; a restarted train rebuilds the window from the open spec PRs and those rows |

## Failure cases

- Red at position i: i refused to its job; specs i+1.. closed, rebuilt on R(i-1).
- Job pushes a new head mid-window: its spec closed; it re-enters at the back; specs behind rebuilt.
- Tranche moves by anything but the window (a plain PR, a hand merge): whole window closed, rebuilt.
- Spec gate green but L's tree differs (GitHub's merge base differs): today's full re-gate; row says so.
- Confirm gate red or cancelled: hold ends with its cause; window behind rebuilt.
- Train killed: on restart, open spec PRs with their rows rebuild the window; ones whose base no
  longer matches are closed with that cause.
- Runner cap: k parallel spec gates plus one confirm; k = 4 keeps the peak about 15 of 20.

## Tests

Unit tests on window.mjs (admission order, priority, provider prefix, red at i, head moved, restart
from rows); a simulated window of 4 with one red at position 1 through train() with stubbed GitHub
(fails without the build: no window, serial); merge `specLand` tree equal and not equal; gate spec
mode and `spec-tested` fast path (receipt from the job PR; draft not skipping; a tree not tested is
not fast); jobMerge cover through a `spec-tested` row. Full suite, cold review, confirming review on
the merge path.
