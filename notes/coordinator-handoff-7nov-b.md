# Coordinator handoff, 7 Nov 2026 ~04:55Z (session_018BhcefrJ17LisCLZSvEMCV)

Previous handoff: notes/coordinator-handoff-7nov.md. Log: notes/coordinator-findings-3-4nov.md (entries 01:47Z–04:55Z). Problem classes: notes/problem-classes.md (C1–C18). Bob's settings files, one per repo: notes/settings/*.settings.json (from notes/r17c-settings.md on the tranche).

## Situation
- Layer 9 MERGED 03:39Z (copy PR 735, 8.88 h). Layer 10 open since 03:39Z: monitoring landed (743), link-sweep landed (745), following (744) republishing/job-syncing, scheduler (748, early, reopen R34/R35) in flight. Early start into layer 11: op-capabilities (PR 752, layer/11 cut ahead). setup-words and record-core joined layer 11 (ruled: setup-words runs first; ~40 layer-11 modules depend on it). The 5 investigation reopens (steps, hypotheses, retrieval, project-roster, observation-log) joined layer 11; ruling: 4 with marks start ≤2 at a time, observation-log gets `layer retest` only.
- Pins: copy and probes at process3 19fe9dd (C8, R14 1b, replay-each, C12 p2, landed-PR readers). process3 tranche since then: 226 C15p3 (d88b577), 227 leftovers (0dc34de).
- BLOCKER: Bob applied R17c settings to the copy (copy PR 755, 04:35Z). Setup check at pin 19fe9dd refuses every `job start` (deny-list, shim-drift) = C17. Builder ef7TXuV has the fix on build/one-settings-policy (751dd0f6, reproduced on the copy's real settings), suite + cold review running, push waiting on the push budget. Merge it the moment it's green, then ONE pin move (copy + probes) at once; tell BOB. Bob's settings stay.
- PUSH CEILING: account at 121/120 at 04:51Z (PD-3 kept at 120, coordinator's call; Bob 6 Nov "BE CAREFUL"). BOB clone 208b86bb was 39 pushes + 512 gh calls (real work + read commands writing state = C18). BOB paused non-essential pushes ~20 min from 04:53Z (only `layer land` for 744/748); its found-mark PRs 756/757 (gates green) wait. My copy config.json coordinator-id push was cancelled (copy process/config.json still names session_018BhcecWcETw22rxhPvoZ53: redo by plain PR p3/coordinator-<date> when budget allows; probes already done, PR 234).
- My notes push (C17/C18 commit) is queued behind the budget; this handoff commit too.

## Open process3 PRs / builder queues
- 229 C16 (census flags modules without ledger entries; ef1pxNY): local merge with tranche 1110/1110; merge on green CI.
- ef7TXuV: (1) C17 build/one-settings-policy — URGENT; (2) build/append-only-state (github/use rows replayed by append; origin head 251c0b1b is DEFECTIVE — do not open until the builder sends head ed06a1b2 or later).
- ef1pxNY: fetch-split measurement 04:12–05:12Z due ~05:15Z (compare 02:25–03:25Z: 275 fetches, 24 state pushes); then C18 (read commands ride the next write; cache per-module walks).
- Merge practice: `merge <n> --plain --rounds <r> --reviewed "..."` from a tranche worktree (/home/user/p3-base) after merging the PR head with the current tranche locally and running `HOME=$(mktemp -d) GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 node --test 'tool/test/*.test.mjs'`. Pin move: `node tool/p3.mjs pin move <slug> --report <me> --why "..." --pin <sha>` prints a session prompt; create_session with it (probe has no BOB address: tell its session the wake send may fail).

## For Bob (step-by-step given to him at ~04:40Z)
1–2. Settings: copy DONE (PR 755). process3 and process3-probes remain (paste notes/settings/<repo>.settings.json over .claude/settings.json via a PR into tranche). After all three: live-test raw `git push` refused, connector call counted, `p3 github audit`; retire the `github note` rule.
3. Investigation Q7–Q9 (paper https://claude.ai/artifact/THTtouNJzkhmHqyR4Pfa4g); pass answers to BOB for the copy's DECISIONS.md.
4. GitHub support ticket (civicsmith suspended 6 Nov).

## Decisions this session (coordinator)
PD-4 (census not-in-layer-map flags, not refuses; in process3 DECISIONS.md via PR 213). Rulings: C13b limits accepted (hidden-path credit from state rows only for 404 PRs); hold-26 lifted to 8 slots; lanes push again; census entries for 49 legacy modules (record, not tool guess); reopens join layer 11 (no early layer open); PD-3 stays 120.

## Scheduled tasks bound to me (rebind to successor)
hourly trig_01M3hYFufXMMvLkn6Xuas2Fz (:51); Phase 1 survival read trig_016cLJDrmGe8aSK8cgKbfd2v (16 Nov 17:00Z); Phase 2 trig_01WrTvQD3gzXNuSGj1fX2Jq6 (18 Nov 17:00Z). Create new ones bound to the successor and delete these.

## Subscriptions to renew
process3 PR 229 (and whatever ef7TXuV opens next).
