Account switch review, 5 Nov (coordinator session_018BhcecCMP7CZRbiR8kruPn). Bob asked why the switch went badly and to fix it so the next one works.

TIMELINE (UTC)
- 05:44 Bob: stop all work for the switch. Old coordinator stopped tasks and sessions, wrote handoff c.
- 05:52 new coordinator on the new account. 05:55 blocked: the account had no GitHub connection. Bob connected it at 05:59.
- 05:59-06:16 ids, ROOT, BOB, MERGER, watcher and tasks started. Every push and merge went as neobobkrause, the repos' owner and admin.
- 06:19 the first setup check (pin move) refused: `account` needs a non-admin collaborator. 06:23 every job start refused for the same reason. 0/20.
- 06:37 Bob closed everything again; the new coordinator started with civicsmith attached at 06:43.
- 06:50-06:58 roles started twice over: four start checks failed because the tranche moved under them.
- 07:07 BOB's first --ready broke its own shallow clone (parallel git); 07:10 BOB had paged 1,843 sessions to count 7.
- 07:12-07:28 the train stalled in a shallow clone, then waited 9 min for its own dead lease.
- 07:18 first job live. 07:28 train running.
- Cost: 0 jobs live 05:44-07:18 (94 min at 0/20, against 19/20 at 05:20). No train land 05:47-07:28 apart from PR 391 at 06:32.

WHY (root causes, not symptoms)
1. No preflight. The process has setup check, but nothing made it the first act of a new account. GitHub not connected, and GitHub connected as the wrong user, were each found by the first act that needed them, after roles and pushes had started.
2. Account-held state was not written down where the new account can read it. Scheduled tasks, live job sessions and role addresses live on the Claude account. The old account's task prompts were unreadable from the new one and were rebuilt from prose; 13 job sessions were stranded and each needed a hand restart; ~40 reports stayed addressed to dead sessions.
3. No order for the restart. Roles were started while the coordinator's own id and pin merges were still moving the tranche, so their start checks failed (four times).
4. Fresh-start defects that only bite on a cold start: a shallow MERGER clone (fixed, PR 148), a killed train cannot retake its own lease (9 min), BOB counts sessions by paging the whole account history (~5 min every wake), a job branch left holding the train's merged-result push needs --fresh-branch by hand (plane), BOB ran git in parallel in one clone.
5. The coordinator held three repositories, so its outward acts raised Bob's permission dialogs (handoff e). Now one repository.

FIX (being built in process3)
- build/account-switch: `p3 switch out` on the old account writes a manifest to the state branch (every scheduled task's name, schedule, prompt and role; every live job with module, branch, PR and state; role addresses; messages in flight), stops the train and releases its lease, and prints the stop acts in order. `p3 switch in` on the new account is the first act: preflight (GitHub reachable, acting user is the collaborator not the admin, push reachable on each repo, approvals hash) and refuses to go on if any fails; then prints the restart in order: coordinator ids, wait for a quiet tranche, ROOT, BOB, MERGER, watcher, the tasks recreated from the manifest bound to the new sessions, every recorded job restarted in one command release-first, then --ready, then old messages re-addressed. A runbook in rulebooks.
- build/restart-speed: session count from the start rows (no history paging), a train can retake its own session's lapsed-process lease, role start checks re-anchor to the tip as job start does, a job whose branch holds the train's merged-result push gets a fresh branch on its next start without a hand choice, and BOB's rulebook: one git user per clone, reviewers in their own clones.
